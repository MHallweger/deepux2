# deepux2
An application that supports mobile UI developers/designers during the design process. The application generates mobile UI suggestions that developers/designers can use as a guide.
The application extracts the individual sections of an application from an existing data set of app screenshots. These are then optimally reassembled into individual screenshots/suggestions based on an AI (SeqGAN).
